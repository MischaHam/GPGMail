<P><B>GPGMail is a plug-in for Apple's Mail, providing a front-end to <code>gpg</code> for some operations. It allows you to read/write encrypted messages, as well as electronically signed messages.</B></P>

<P>GPGMail extends Apple's Mail application and allows you to read and send PGP authenticated and/or encrypted messages. You can use GPGMail for plain text and MIME messages, following <A HREF="index.html#RFC3156">RFC 3156</A>.</P>
<P><B>GPGMail does not contain any encryption code</B>: it is a client to <code>gpg</code> executable.</P>
<P>GPGMail is a complete hack, relying on Mail's private internal API. Use it at your own risks!</P>

<P>Once started, Mail has a new submenu, <B>PGP</B>, in its
<B>Message</B> menu, containing the following items:</P>
<CENTER><TABLE><TR valign="bottom">
					<TD>
                        <img ALT="GPG" src="images/GPG.gif" width="48" height="48" border="0"><BR>
                        <UL>
							<li>Decrypt
							<li>Authenticate
							<li>Encrypt New Message
							<li>Encryption Keys<ul>
				                    <li>Use Passphrase Encryption
				                    <li>Automatic Choice

				                    <li>(list of public keys)

							<li>Signing Keys<ul>
							         <li>(list of secret keys)
							     </ul>
							 <li>Force Use of PGP-MIME
							 <li>Refresh Keys
						</UL>
					<TD><IMG src="images/PGPSubMenu.png" ALT="PGP submenu">
				</TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<P>There is also a new submenu, <B>PGP Keys</B>, in menu <B>View</B>, allowing you to choose on-the-fly which attributes must be displayed for keys.</P>

<P>Finally, in menu <B>Window</B>, a new item <B>PGP Key Search</B> displays a PGP key search panel when clicked.</P>


<P>Mail also has a new Preferences panel in which you
can:</P>
<UL>
<li>choose your default PGP key
<li>when to encrypt/sign/decrypt/verify, etc.
</UL>
<CENTER><IMG src="images/Preferences.gif" ALT="Preferences panel"></CENTER>

<P>When composing a new message, some new buttons appear in the composer window:</P>
<CENTER><IMG src="images/Compose.png" ALT="Compose window"></CENTER>
<P>They allow you to choose which key you want to sign with, and which keys have to be used for encryption, when enabled. By default, GPGMail will try to find out by itself which keys are needed for encryption, according to the recipients email addresses; keys are listed in the <b>Keys</b> popdown button. In case it misses some keys, a warning icon will be displayed next to the popdown button. At that time you can ask GPGMail to search for missing keys on key servers (if <code>gpg</code> has been configured correctly, using for example <A target="_blank" HREF="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">GPGPreferences</A>), using menu item <B>Download...</B> in popdown menu.</P>
<CENTER><IMG src="images/SearchKeys.png" ALT="PGP Key Search panel"></CENTER>
<P>In the Composer window, you can also add two toolbar items (by customizing the toolbar) to set the
encryption (on/off) and add or not your PGP signature; you can also use menu items
<B>PGP/Encrypt New Message</B> and <B>PGP/Sign New Message</B>. When you compose
a new message, you can sign it (you will be asked for your key
passphrase), and/or you can encrypt it. Note that encryption/signature is always applied on the whole message.</P>
<CENTER><IMG src="images/Signing.png" ALT="Message Authentication panel"></CENTER>

<P>GPGMail can use two different formats for encryption/signature: if your message consists only of plain text (no attachments, no rich text attributes like bold, italic, etc.), GPGMail will use the old PGP format, with inline ASCII-armored signature/encryption. In the other case, it will use the new OpenPGP/MIME format, with MIME attachments, which is not recognized by some mail agents like Outlook/Entourage/Eudora, but welcomed by Sylpheed, Mulberry and others. If you prefer GPGMail to always use the OpenPGP/MIME format, then you can set it in preferences, or using menu item <B>Message</B>/<B>PGP</B>/<B>Force Use of PGP-MIME</B>.</P>

<P>You can also apply some rules to let GPGMail decide when to encrypt/sign a message, according to the recipients. Look at GPGMail Composing preferences, and Robert Goldsmith's <A HREF="index.html#ABKey">ABKey</A> bundle.</P>

<P>AddressBook groups are also supported: if you use a group's name as a message recipient, and all members of this group have a valid PGP key, then GPGMail will use all these keys.</P>

<P>When you browse through messages, GPGMail can operate automatically, or on-demand. In automatic mode, it tries to authenticate or decrypt the currently selected message; in manual mode, you click on a button/menu to decrypt or authenticate the currently selected message; you can also use the contextual menu.</P>
<P>After authenticating a message, the signature information is displayed, in short or long form.</P>

<CENTER><IMG src="images/Decrypting.gif" ALT="Decrypting a message"></CENTER>

<P>Encryption/decryption of plain text and MIME messages works.</P>
<P>Decryption of HTML messages works too, if there's a plain text alternative, but you need to tell Mail to display the plain text alternative after you decrypted the message (menu <B>View</B>/<B>Message</B>/<B>Plain Text Alternative</B>). Don't expect better support in the future!</P>

<P>If you allow passphrase cacheing, passphrase is either stored in cache during
a small amount of time (default is 60 seconds) - if it has not been used during this time, cache
is cleared -, or stored in your default keychain. Note that this feature does not work when <CODE>gpg-agent</CODE> is used (bug <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2471368&group_id=222344&atid=1055153" target="_blank">2471368</a>).</P>

<H2><A NAME="Requirements">Requirements</A></H2>
<P>You need <B>MacOS X 10.6.x</B>; GPGMail will not work as-is on other OS versions, because the internals of Apple's Mail changes on every revision.</P>
<P>You need a <code>gpg</code> version &gt;= 1.4.0 (or <code>gpg2</code>), usually installed in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>, but GPGMail will search for <code>gpg2</code> then <code>gpg</code> in several locations (<code>/usr/local/bin</code>, <code>/opt/local/bin</code>, <code>/sw/bin</code>) and use the first found one. Or you can change user default <code>GPGOpenPGPExecutablePath</code> to set a different path, or use <A target="_blank" HREF="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">GPGPreferences 1.3</A>.</P>
<P>You can use MacGPG distribution, available at <A target="_blank" HREF="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">MacGPG web site</A>, or, for <code>gpg2</code>, <A target="_blank" HREF="http://macgpg2.sourceforge.net/">MacGPG2 web site</A>.</P>
